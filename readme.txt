### Here are my web 3 notes and my journey using Harkirat's cohort. 

Imp Points :--- 

[Day - 1 ] ---> [ https://projects.100xdevs.com/tracks/web3-orientation/Web3-Cohort---Orientation-1 ]

-- We are learning blockchain and why we need them and leading to bitcoin and other web3 stuff. 
1. Hashing --- It is not encryption, it is converting a given input into some random string which is sort of irreversible .
   : SHA256 - one of the hashing algorithm 
   Q: what are encodings and different number like hex, octal and bit? do a bit of reading on them ;
   : we can use a crypto node module to do hashing using createHash function. also there exist a hash.startsWith(prefix) method which tells whether the hash starts with this prefix or not.  
   :  hash.startsWith(prefix) ---> super important method we use to brute force find the a pattern of sha . like we did check git log
